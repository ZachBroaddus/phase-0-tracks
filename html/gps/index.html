<!--
What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
	-Semantic tags give meaning to specific elements that can be useful to both the browser and to developers. I suppose the question of which semantic tags are most useful is somewhat subjective, but the <form> tag seems to have a lot of utility. Really, the semantic tags are all more useful than something like a <div> tag, because they provide more specific information about the element.
What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
	-The browser reads an html file and displays elements from top to bottom. Positioning can be further manipulated by using block/inline elements and changing the styling of elements using css.
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
	-In addition to the built-in snippets, users can create their own snippets to save time, rather than typing frequently used blocks of code from scratch each time they are needed.
What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
	-For me, the most difficult thing is choosing the appropriate semantic tag for each case. I think this will become easier with practice and the Html5 Doctor flowchart will definitely help.
