# Take a word from player 1
# Give player 2 a number of guesses that is equal to the length of the word in letters
# Take a guess from player 2, in the form of a letter or a word if they would like to guess the word outright
# Allow the user to solve the puzzle at any time by guessing the word outright
# Compare the user's guess to the word entered by player 1
# Subtract from their number of remaining tries if they guess incorrectly
# Record the user's guess history if their guess was a letter
# If the user makes the same guess twice, do not count it against their total number of guesses
# Each time a user makes a guess, reveal to the user whether the word contained their guess letter and the position(s) of their
# guess letter in the word
# All other letters in the word will be hidden from the user, but displayed as blank spaces
# Allow the user to make guesses until they run out of tries or until they guess the word correctly
# Display a congratulatory message if the player wins or a taunting message if they lose
