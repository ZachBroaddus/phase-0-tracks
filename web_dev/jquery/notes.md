JQuery Exploration Plan:

I learn pretty well from watching someone do something and then doing it myself, so I'll start by looking for a useful JQuery tutorial video or two on YouTube. I'll take notes while watching the video(s) about topics that might require further research. Then, I'll research the topics from my notes using a Google search. Finally, I'll look for bookmark-able JQuery resources that might help me as I build a small project. 

I went over the alotted time because actually installing JQuery was not very straightforward. Once that was done, I was able to find a video series that helped me a ton. I didn't really have questions about the content of the videos because they were very straighforward, but I did look up the jQuery API docs and a jQuery cheat sheet.
